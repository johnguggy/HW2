    <h1>John Guggenbiller</h1>
    <h2>Biography:</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I am a 24 year old student at Tri-C attending Cleveland Codes Academy.
        I also have bachelor's degree in Film and Digital Media from Cleveland State University.<br />
        I consider myself to be kind and thoughtful to others as well as soft-spoken.
        Even though I am from Ohio, half of my family is from Colombia so I consider my family very important to me.
    </p>
    <h3>Hobbies:</h3>
    <p>My hobbies include playing video games, going to see the newest movies, riding my bike, as well as writing short screenplays.</p>
    <h3>Places Travelled:</h3>
    <p>
        I have been to Memphis, Pittsburgh, Tampa, Hilton Head, and Cancun,
        but my <i>favorite</i> trip has to be when I went to Cali, Colombia to visit family.
    </p>
    <h3>Ambitions:</h3>
    <p>
        My biggest ambition is to get a career as a software developer
        but I also think it would be interesting to work on a travel show to see different places around the world.
