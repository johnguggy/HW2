	<h1>John Guggenbiller</h1>
	<h2>Biography</h2>
	<p>I am a 24 year old student at Tri-C attending Cleveland Codes Academy. I also have bachelor's degree in Film and Digital Media from Cleveland State University.
	   I consider myself to be kind and thoughtful to others as well as soft-spoken. Even though I am from Ohio, half of my family is from Colombia so I consider my family very important to me.
	   My hobbies include playing video games, going to see the newest movies, riding my bike, as well as writing short screenplays.
	   I have been to Memphis, Pittsburgh, Tampa, Hilton Head, and Cancun, but my <i>favorite</i> trip has to be when I went to Cali, Colombia to visit family.
	   My biggest ambition is to get a career as a software developer but I also think it would be interesting to work on a travel show to see different places around the world.</p>
